Creating and using AWS KMS KEY:-

1> create an IAM user who will be accessing the KMS key which we are going to create or fix an existing user 

2> goto aws iam console and click (Encryption Keys) https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-2#/encryptionKeys/us-east-1

3> Create Key > Alais(Give name of the key for easy understanding) > Advanced Options(KMS) > Next Step > Add Tag Values > Define Key Usage Permissions (Add the user whom you want to KMS key to be accessed or Add External AWS Accounts by going to advanced) > Preview the policy > Finish 

4> Take a note of the KMS ARN and KMS ID with the alias name you created and 
Alias: master
KMS ID: 2ef39919-a9b7-44b8-9304-8ca5b7df5bf8
KMS ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:042147377548:key/2ef39919-a9b7-44b8-9304-8ca5b7df5bf8

5> Create a new Bucket or use an existing one. In the Bucket Policies of the bucket add the below policy (Change "masteri" with the "Bucket name" and "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:042147377548:key/2ef39919-a9b7-44b8-9304-8ca5b7df5bf8" with the "arn of kms" which was obtained )

               }
           }
       }
   ]
}


6> Test the upload to your s3 by uploading a test documnet with the user you gave access

aws s3 cp sourceFile s3://bucketName   #(You will Get Access Denied)

example:
aws s3 cp screen.sh s3://masteri 

upload failed: ./screen.sh to s3://masteri/screen.sh An error occurred (AccessDenied) when calling the PutObject operation: Access Denied

>Now try with the valid upload command

aws s3 cp /filepath s3://mybucket/filename --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id <key id>

example: 
aws s3 cp screen.sh s3://masteri --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id 2ef39919-a9b7-44b8-9304-8ca5b7df5bf8
